Challenge 1: Ensuring seamless network transitions between 2G/3G/4G for uninterrupted service
Problem:

In a telecom network, users move between different network areas where coverage may switch between 2G, 3G, and 4G (LTE).
If handover (switching from one network to another) is not optimized, it can cause call drops, voice distortions, or data session interruptions.
For example, during a handover from LTE to 3G, if the network selection algorithm is not efficient, 
the user might experience delays or failures in connecting to the new network.
Solution:

Worked on handover algorithms that determine when and how a device should switch networks.
Optimized key network parameters like:
Signal strength thresholds (RSRP, RSRQ, SINR) – Adjusted the values to ensure the best possible transition.
Timer settings for handover decisions – Fine-tuned the duration before a handover is triggered to avoid unnecessary switching.
Load balancing techniques – Ensured that users are evenly distributed across available network resources.
Tested these optimizations using simulated network environments and real-time performance data.
As a result, the network reduced call drops and improved user experience for voice and data sessions.
